# ðŸ©º Eye Disease Classification Using Deep Learning

A Django-based web application that detects eye diseases from retinal images using a deep learning model.  
This version focuses on **Cataract detection , Normal eye** **Glaucoma** , **Diabetic Retinopathy**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Upload retinal images directly from browser.
- Deep learning inference using TensorFlow/Keras model.
- Multi Class classification: **Normal Eye** / **Cataract Detected**.
- Displays confidence score alongside prediction.
- Web interface built with Django for easy interaction.

## ðŸ“– Background
Eye diseases are a major cause of preventable blindness worldwide.  
Automated detection using deep learning can:
- Reduce diagnostic time.
- Assist ophthalmologists in preliminary screening.
- Increase access to healthcare in underserved areas.

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to analyze retinal images and classify them into categories based on patterns learned from a labeled dataset.

## ðŸ§  Model Training
- **Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras
- **Dataset:** Preprocessed retinal images resized to **224x224**.
- **Preprocessing:** Normalization to [0,1] pixel range.
- **Architecture:** Custom CNN / Transfer Learning (e.g., MobileNet, EfficientNet).
- **Training Environment:** GPU-enabled Colab / Local machine.
- **Loss Function:** Binary Crossentropy.
- **Optimizer:** Adam.
